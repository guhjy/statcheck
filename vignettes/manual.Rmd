## What statcheck Can and Cannot Do

This manual provides detailed instructions for the installation and use of the
free R package "statcheck: Extract statistics and recompute p-values" (Epskamp &
Nuijten, 2016). For a more concise manual check out the R Help files of
statcheck (`?statcheck`).

Before I get to the technical parts of installing and using statcheck, please
consider for a moment what statcheck can and cannot do. The package statcheck is
a program that automatically extracts statistics from articles and recomputes
their p-values. It works as follows:

**1. Convert PDF and HTML files to plain text.**

PDF files are converted using the program Xpdf, HTML files are read in by R and
automatically converted to raw text files.

**2. Scan text for statistical results**

statcheck searches for specific patterns and recognizes statistical results from
t, F, r, $\chi^2$, and Z tests. statcheck can only read these results if the
results are reported exactly according to the APA guidelines:

* t(df) = value, p = value
* F(df1, df2) = value, p = value
* r(df) = value, p = value
* $\chi^2$ (df, N = value) = value, p = value *(N is optional, $\Delta$G is also
  included, since it follows a $\chi^2$ distribution)*
* Z = value, p = value 

All regular expressions take into account that test statistics and p values may
be exactly (=) or inexactly (< or >) reported. Different spacing has also been
taken into account, and case is ignored.

**3. Use test statistics and degrees of freedom to recompute p value**

By default the recomputed p value is two sided. 

**4. Compare reported and recomputed p value**

This comparison takes into account how the results were reported, e.g. p < .05
is treated differently than p = .05. Incongruent p values are marked as an
"Error". If the reported result is significant and the recomputed result is not,
or vice versa, the result is marked as a "Decision Error".

Correct rounding is taken into account. For instance, a reported t value of 2.35
could correspond to an actual value of 2.345 to 2.354 with a range of p values
that can slightly deviate from the recomputed p value. statcheck will not count
cases like this as errors.

Furthermore, one-sided testing is taken into account: if somewhere in the
article the words "one-tailed", "one-sided", or "directional" are mentioned, and
the result would have been correct if it was one-sided, it is counted as a
correctly reported one-sided test. However, as [Felix
Thoemmes](http://www.human.cornell.edu/bio.cfm?netid=fjt36) pointed out to me,
this only works if the one-tailed result was in line with the one-tailed
hypothesis. If you expected a negative effect, but found a positive one, your
p-value would be 1-p/2. Unfortunately statcheck can't recognize this and will
wrongly flag this as an inconsistency.

For a detailed validity study of statcheck, see our recent paper "The prevalence
of statistical reporting errors in psychology (1985-2013)" ([Nuijten,
Hartgerink, Van Assen, Epskamp, & Wicherts, in press](https://mbnuijten.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/nuijtenetal_2015_reportingerrorspsychology1.pdf)).

Note that statcheck assumes that the p-value is the inconsistent value, but it
could just as well be the case that the test statistic or degrees of freedom
contain a reporting error. statcheck merely detects wether a set of numbers is
consistent with each other.

Finally, as [Nick Brown](http://www.rug.nl/staff/n.j.l.brown) pointed out to me,
note that some cases are not flagged as an inconsistency, whereas they might
look suspicious to a human reader. For instance, take the following case:

> We found a significant difference, t(99) = 1.95, p = .05.

Here, the recalculated p-value is actually .054, which contradicts the claim
that this finding is significant. However, statcheck will not flag this result
as an inconsistency, since, well, it's not. If you round ".054" to two decimals,
it actually is .05. This is an example of a case in which a human might raise
his/her eyebrows, but statcheck strictly adheres to the math: .054 is correctly
rounded to .05, and hence not inconsistent.

## Installation

There are several programs you need to install before you can start using
statcheck. First you need to install R, and preferably the R environment
RStudio. Furthermore, you will need the program Xpdf to enable statcheck to
convert PDF articles to plain text files. In the last step you can load the
package statcheck in R. The next sections explain where and how to download and
install these programs.

### R and RStudio

To use statcheck you first need to install R. R is a free programming language
and environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can download it from
https://cran.r-project.org/. If you want you can now run R via Rstudio. Rstudio
is an interface for R and it has several nice tricks that can make programming
in R easier (syntax highlighting, more point-and-click options, etc.). You can
obtain the latest version of Rstudio from http://rstudio.com.

### Xpdf

statcheck relies on the program Xpdf that converts PDF files to plain text
files. To download and install Xpdf, follow the steps for Windows or Mac below.

#### Xpdf for Windows

Many thanks to [Daniel Lakens](https://sites.google.com/site/lakens2/Home) who
created the step by step installation manual for Xpdf.

**1. Download Xpdf and unzip the contents (especially bin32 and bin 64) of the 
Xpdf to a folder: <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html>**

**2. Close R and RStudio **

**3. Right click the 'This PC' icon in windows explorer: **

<!-- <img src="Xpdf_screenshot1.png" align="middle" height="100" width="166" margin="0 auto" /> -->

**4. Click 'properties' **

<!-- <img src="Xpdf_screenshot2.png" align="middle" height="130" width="215" margin="0 auto" /> -->

**5. Click 'Advanced system settings' **

<!-- <img src="Xpdf_screenshot3.png" align="middle" height="110" width="183" margin="0 auto" /> -->

**6. Click 'Environment Variables' **

<!-- <img src="Xpdf_screenshot4.png" align="middle" height="220" width="365" margin="0 auto" /> -->

**7. Select 'Path' and click 'Edit' **

<!-- <img src="Xpdf_screenshot5.png" align="middle" height="220" width="365" margin="0 auto" /> -->

**8. Add the path to the folder containing the Xpdf folder, and specifically the
folder bin32 (for a x86 system) or bin64 (for a 64 bit system). Add the path
after a ; seperator.**

<!-- <img src="Xpdf_screenshot6.png" align="middle" height="330" width="547" margin="0 auto" /> -->

#### Xpdf on Mac

If you want to run statcheck on a Mac, follow these steps:

**Step 1.**

Download XQuartz. XQuartz is an open source version of the X.Org X Window System
that runs on OS X. You can download it at
http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/.

**Step 2.**
Download the binaries for Xpdf and unzip them (see step 1 in the instructions
above).

**Step 3.**
Add the location of the Xpdf binaries to your path. For a step-by-step
instruction how to add something to the path on Mac, see 
[this website](http://architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/#.Vjh6SLerS70).

If these three steps don't work (they seem to create some problems on MacOS
10.11.5), you can try the following other steps:

```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Install homebrew: open terminal and paste 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Install xquartz: open terminal and paste 
brew cask install xquartz

# Install xpdf: open terminal and paste
brew install homebrew/x11/xpdf
```

Thanks to [Eiko Fried](http://eiko-fried.com/) for figuring this out for me!

### statcheck from CRAN

After you installed Xpdf, you can load the R package statcheck with the
following lines of code:

```{r CRAN, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("statcheck")
library("statcheck")
```

statcheck is now ready to use!

### Optional: statcheck from GitHub

statcheck is constantly being updated, which means that the version on CRAN is
not always the latest version. Instead of downloading statcheck from CRAN, you
can also download the latest version of statcheck directly from GitHub with the
following lines of R code:

```{r github, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("MicheleNuijten/statcheck")
library("statcheck")
```

Note that you still need to have Xpdf installed before you can download and run
statcheck.

## Using statcheck

### Using statcheck on a raw string of text

The most basic function of statcheck is to extract statistics from a raw string
of text, recalculate the p-value, and report back the findings. In the example
below I simply feed statcheck a string of text with some statistics in it, and
it gives me back a table with the results. I'll go over the results below.

```{r basic_ex1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "blablabla the effect was very significant (t(48) = 1.02, p < .05)"
statcheck(txt)
```

Note that when you want to scan a Z test, you need to place a space in front of
Z. This is because of an ugly hack I had to build in: sometimes Z tests were
read as $\chi^2$ and this was the easiest way to avoid that:

```{r space_before_stats, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
statcheck("z = 1.95, p = .05")

# instead, type
statcheck(" z = 1.95, p = .05")
```

The output table is quite large, and because of the screen size it often gets
divided over several lines (as is the case now). This can make the output a bit
hard to read. I pasted an unfolded table below to give you an idea what it looks
like.

<!-- <img src="statcheckOutput_screenshot3.png" align="middle" height="600" width="996" margin="0 auto" /> -->

I'll go over the different parts of the output below.

#### statcheck output: part 1

The first part of the output (as shown below) shows which statistics are
extracted from the input.

```{r basic_ex2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "blablabla the effect was very significant (F(2, 65) = 3.02, p < .05)"
stat <- statcheck(txt)

stat[, 1:8]
```

`Source` indicates from which "Source" the statistic on this particular line was
extracted. When you feed statcheck raw strings of text (as I did here), it
numbers the objects in the input vector. Here I only fed statcheck one string,
so `Source` is 1. If you feed statcheck an article, `Source` shows the file name
of the article.

The next columns show the full result that was extracted, split up in the
different elements. Splitting up the different elements that were extracted can
be useful if you for instance want to investigate how many F-values an article
or set of articles contains, or if you want to investigate the distribution of
extracted p-values.

#### statcheck output: part 2

The second part of the output, as shown below, shows the result of the consistency check. 

```{r basic_ex3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
stat[,9:12]
```

The column 'Computed' shows the computed p-value that statcheck calculated based
on the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. It depends on the
argument 'OneTailedTests' whether this is a two-sided (default;
'OneTailedTests=FALSE') or one-sided p-value ('OneTailedTests=FALSE').

In the column 'Raw' you find the complete result as extracted by statcheck. This
is the concatenated version of the information in the previous columns.

The columns 'Error' and 'DecisionError' show the final results of the
consistency check. In this example, 'Error' is 'TRUE', which means that the
reported p-value is inconsistent with the reported test statistic and degrees of
freedom. You can also see this in the output, where the reported p-value is "<
.05", whereas the computed p-value is .0557. This also means that
'DecisionError' is also 'TRUE', which indicates not only that the reported
p-value is inconsistent, but it also changes the statistical conclusion: the
reported p-value is significant, whereas the recomputed one is not.Note that a
result can only be a 'DecisionError' when it is also an 'Error'.

#### statcheck output: part 3

The last part of the output shows some extra information about the extracted
result and the article it was extracted from.

```{r basic_ex4, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
stat[,13:15]
```

The column 'OneTail' indicates whether a result *could have been* a one-tailed
test. This means that the result would have been correct if it is a one-tailed
test.

The column 'OneTailedInTxt' indicates whether the string "one-tailed",
"one-sided", or "directional" was found in the full text that statcheck scanned.
If 'OneTailedInTxt==TRUE', it could be a good indication that some or all of the
tests are one-tailed, which means that some of the flagged inconsistencies might
not be inconsistent at all.

Finally, the column 'APAfactor' indicates the proportion of all detected
p-values that were part of a fully APA reported NHST result. It gives a rought
indication of how many statistical tests statcheck may have missed because of
reporting issues.

#### statcheck output: messages

In some cases, statcheck will evaluate a string of text and on top of the output
it will also give back one or two messages:

```{r messages, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
msg_example <- "Result 1 is t(100) = 1, p < 0.001, and result 2 is 
                t(48) = 1.82, p < .05, all tests were one-tailed."
msg_results <- statcheck(msg_example)
```

In the first message, "Check the significance level", statcheck warns you that
even though it assumed an $\alpha$ of .05, there might be 'DecisionErrors' in
the text you scanned if $\alpha = .1$ or $\alpha = .01$. It is advised to check
the full text of the article to look up the significance level.

In the second message, "Check for one tailed tests", statcheck warns you that
some of the flagged inconsistencies could be caused by the use of one-tailed
tests. It is advised to check the full text of the article to see if a result is
actually consistent because a one tailed test was used.

#### statcheck output: no results found

It is of course possible that the text you want to check doesn't contain any
(correctly reported) APA results. In that case, statcheck will give the
following notification:

```{r noresults, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
txt <- "All the results were significant, all ps < .05"
statcheck(txt)
```

### Using statcheck on a PDF article

One of the main advantages of statcheck is that it can automatically extract
statistical results from articles, so that you don't have to enter them
manually. Instead of the 'statcheck' function, you use the 'checkPDF' function,
which automatically calls statcheck.

There are three ways to select an article using 'checkPDF'.

The first way is to specify the entire path of the article you want to scan:

```{r checkPDF_path, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
checkPDF("C:/Dropbox/Science/Papers/my_article.pdf")
```

The second way is to specify the location of the article in your working
directory and then run 'checkPDF':

```{r checkPDF_wd, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Dropbox/Science/Papers/")
checkPDF("my_article.pdf")
```

The third and last way is not specifying anything:

```{r checkPDF_nothing, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
checkPDF()
```

If you don't specify a file, you will get a point-and-click pop-up in which you
can select the article you want to scan.

Note that there can be type setting issues in PDF articles. To be able to read
PDF, statcheck uses the program Xpdf to convert a text in PDF into plain text.
However, sometimes mathematical symbols such as "<" or "=" are switched by
images in the text, which Xpdf cannot translate into plain text. If that is the
case, statcheck will miss these results. I would therefore advise to use HTML
articles when possible.

### Using statcheck on an HTML article

You can use statcheck on an HTML article by using the function 'checkHTML'. This
function works in the same way as 'checkPDF' (see the section above).

If you have access to both the PDF and the HTML version of an article, I would
advise to check the HTML article to avoid type setting issues.

### Using statcheck on a folder of articles

It is also possible to automatically let statcheck check an entire folder of
articles with the functions 'checkPDFdir' (scans all the PDF articles in the
specified folder), 'checkHTMLdir' (scans all the HTML files in the specified
folder), or simply 'checkdir' (scans both PDF and HTML files in a folder).

Specifying the folder/directory works similarly as specifying a file in the
'checkPDF' or 'checkHTML' function (see sections above):

```{r checkdir, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
checkdir("C:/Dropbox/Science/Papers/")
# or
checkdir()
```

All three functions to check an entire directory have an argument with which you
can specify if you also want to check all subdirectories within the directory
you specified: 'subdir=TRUE'. By default, these functions will check everything
in a directory, also the subdirectories. If you don't want to check
subdirectories, you can set this argument to false.

```{r checkdir_subdir, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# checks subdirectories as well
checkdir("C:/Dropbox/Science/Papers/")
# does not check the subdirectories
checkdir("C:/Dropbox/Science/Papers/",subdir = FALSE)
```

Lastly, there is an extra argument in 'checkHTMLdir', namely 'extension=TRUE'.
This argument controls whether statcheck will search the specified directories
for files with the extension ".htm" or ".html", or if it will just check
everything. This argument is mainly useful when you hide file extensions in your
Explorer or Finder.

### Choosing the right arguments

The statcheck function requires several arguments, most of which have a default
value. The arguments control aspects such as: the assumed alpha level, how
one-tailed tests are treated, and which types of statistics should be checked.
These are all statcheck's arguments with their default values:

```{r arguments_statcheck, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, comment = ""}
call_example <- capture.output(str(args(statcheck), width = 60))
cat(paste(sub("function ", "statcheck", call_example), collapse = "\n"))
```

All these arguments can also be specified in the functions to check entire articles or folders of articles. E.g., when using 'checkPDF', you can also specify specific arguments as follows:

```{r arguments_checkPDF, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
checkPDF("my_article.pdf", OneTailedTxt=TRUE, alpha=.01)
```

I will go over all arguments below.

#### x
The argument 'x' defines the main input variable: a string of text from which you'd like to extract and check the statistics. This is the only argument without a default value.

```{r x, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
txt <- "blablabla the effect was very significant (t(100)=1, p < 0.001)"
statcheck(txt)
```

Or directly:
```{r x_directly, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
statcheck("blablabla the effect was very significant (t(100)=1, p < 0.001)")
```

It is also possible to evaluate a vector of strings:
```{r x_vector, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt1 <- "t(100) = 1, p < 0.001"
txt2 <- "F(2,45) = 2.81, p = .45"
statcheck(c(txt1,txt2))
```

#### stat
The argument 'stat' defines which type of statistics will be extracted. By default statcheck extracts all the statistics it can read: t, F,  correlations, $\chi^2$, and Z. With 'stat' you can tell statcheck to only extract a selection of those statistics or even just one type, e.g.:

```{r stat_t, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "blablabla result 1 is t(100) = 1, p < 0.001, and result 2 is F(2,45) = 2.81, p = .45"
statcheck(txt, stat="t")
```

Or when you're specifically looking for only t statistics and correlations:
```{r stat_tr, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "blablabla result 1 is t(100) = 1, p < 0.001, and result 2 is F(2,45) = 2.81, p = .45"
statcheck(txt, stat=c("t", "cor"))
```

By default, statcheck extracts all statistics it can read.

#### OneTailedTests
The argument 'OneTailedTests' defines whether we treat all extracted tests as two-tailed ('OneTailedTests=FALSE'; default) or as one-tailed ('OneTailedTests=TRUE'):

```{r OneTailedTests, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "F(2,45) = 2.81, p = .45"
statcheck(txt, OneTailedTests=TRUE)
```

In the chunk above, the extracted test will be treated as a one-tailed test. Note that the computed p-value in the output now is divided by two.

This argument is not very "smart". It will consider ALL extracted tests as one-tailed, even when that is impossible (e.g., when the df1 of an F test is > 2).

#### alpha
The argument 'alpha' defines which level of significance statcheck will assume. This argument defaults to $\alpha$ = .05, the widely used criterium in psychology.

If a result isn't a DecisionError with $\alpha$ = .05, but it would be when $\alpha$ = .01 or $\alpha$ = .10, statcheck will print a message advising you to look up the actual level of significance that is used in the article. If it turns out that an $\alpha$ of .01 is used, you can adapt that in statcheck:

```{r alpha, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "F(2,45) = 5.81, p = .03"

# default level of significance = .05
statcheck(txt)

# change level of significance
statcheck(txt, alpha=.01)
```

Note that when $\alpha$=.01 this result is counted as a 'DecisionError'.

#### pEqualAlphaSig
The argument 'pEqualAlphaSig' defines whether a p-value equal to $\alpha$ is treated as significant ('pEqualAlphaSig=TRUE'; default) or not ('pEqualAlphaSig=FALSE'). 

By convention, a result is deemed significant when p < $\alpha$, which would correspond with the setting 'pEqualAlphaSig=FALSE'. However, when we inspected all instances of published papers in which statcheck found "p = .05", we found that in almost 95% of the cases the authors had interpreted the result as significant (Nuijten et al., in press). Because of this finding, we decided to count p =< $\alpha$ as significant by default.

This example illustrates the difference between the two options:

```{r pEqualAlphaSig, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "F(2,45) = 4.10, p = .05"

# default pEqualAlphaSig=TRUE
statcheck(txt)

# change level of significance
statcheck(txt, pEqualAlphaSig=FALSE)
```

Note that in the default setting this result was not counted as a 'DecisionError'. After all, the reported "p = .05" is counted as significant, and even though the computed p-value (p = .02) is not consistent with p = .05, it is still significant.

In the version where 'pEqualAlphaSig=FALSE', this result is counted as a 'DecisionError', because here the reported result is not significant (only p < .05 is counted as significant, not p = .05), whereas the computed result is.

#### pZeroError
The argument 'pZeroError' controls whether statcheck will count a p-value reported as "p=.000" as an error (default, 'pZeroError=TRUE') or not ('pZeroError=FALSE'). 

We decided to count these cases as an error, because according to the APA reporting guidelines, a p-value smaller than .001 should be reported as "p<.001", and never as "p=.000". Furthermore, a p-value can never be exactly zero, so it makes no sense to report it as such.

If you find these criteria too stringent, you can set 'pZeroError' to 'FALSE'.

#### OneTailedTxt
The argument 'OneTailedTxt' controls whether statcheck will try to identify and correct for one-tailed tests. This is one of the most important arguments in statcheck. Our validity study showed that statcheck's accuracy improved when 'OneTailedTxt=TRUE' (Nuijten et al., in press).

By default, 'OneTailedTxt=FALSE' and statcheck will treat all tests it finds the same, depending on your settings for 'OneTailedTests'. However, you can tell statcheck to actively look for tests that might be one-tailed by setting 'OneTailedTxt=TRUE'.

When 'OneTailedTxt=TRUE', statcheck will search the entire text for the keywords "one-tailed", "one-sided", and "directional" (taking spacing issues etc. into account). When statcheck finds at least one of those keywords AND an initially inconsistent result would be consistent if it was a one-tailed test, then statcheck treats this case as a one-tailed test and counts it as consistent.

```{r OneTailedTxt, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "... t(48) = 1.82, p < .05, all tests were one-tailed."

# default OneTailedTxt=FALSE
statcheck(txt)

# actively look for instances of one-tailed tests
statcheck(txt, OneTailedTxt=TRUE)
```

Note that in the first, default scenario the result is treated both as an 'Error' and a 'DecisionError'. However, if 'OneTailedTxt' is set to 'TRUE', statcheck recognizes this test a one-tailed test and doesn't flag it as an inconsistency. Note, however, that the computed p-value in the output still corresponds to a two-tailed test.

#### AllPValues
By default, statcheck searches for fully reported NHST results (test statistic, degrees of freedom if necessary, and a p-value). However, if you set the argument 'AllPValues' to 'TRUE', statcheck will only search for p-values:

```{r AllPValues, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "We found a significant difference between groups, F(3, 147) = 3.45, p = .02. Group 1 had a higher mean than group 2, t(48) = 1.56, p<.05, but did not differ from group 3, t(48) = .34, p = .74. We found no difference between men and women, t(148) = .73, p = .763."
statcheck(txt, AllPValues=TRUE)
```

This option merely allows you to extract the p-values, it doesn't extract enough information to recalculate anything.

### Plot statcheck results

To get a rough overview of the inconsistencies in a paper, you can use statcheck's plot function:

```{r plot, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "We found a significant difference between groups, F(3, 147) = 3.45, p = .02. Group 1 had a higher mean than group 2, t(48) = 1.56, p<.05, but did not differ from group 3, t(48) = .34, p = .74. We found no difference between men and women, t(148) = .73, p = .763."
stat <- statcheck(txt)

stat

plot(stat)
```

The plot shows the reported p-values (x-axis) against the computed p-values (y-axis). Exactly reported p-values (e.g., p = .74) should lie on the diagonal. The dotted lines indicate the region of significance ($\alpha$ = .05 by default). The colors of the dots indicate whether this particular p-value was an inconsistency or even a decision error. 

By default, the plot is created with ggplot2 in APA style. Many thanks to [John Sakaluk](http://johnsakaluk.com/) for writing the APA style plot function. It is also possible to plot the statcheck results without using ggplot2:

```{r plot_nonapa, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
plot(stat, APA=FALSE)
```

When 'APA=false', it is possible to modify the plot's graphical parameters:

```{r plot_nonapa_par, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
plot(stat, APA=FALSE, cex=2, axes=FALSE)
```

The non-APA layout is also the layout that statcheck uses in the 'identify' function that is explained in the next section.

### Identify points in plot

If you plotted many statcheck results and there is one point that stands out in the graph, but it's hard to find in the statcheck output, the 'identify' function might be useful.

'identify' allows you to click on points in the plot to literally identify them in the data frame with statcheck results. Note: this function is only available if you run statcheck in RStudio.

For instance, if we go back to the example in the section above, we might be interested in the two p-values that were flagged as inconsistencies.

```{r identify, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt <- "We found a significant difference between groups, F(3, 147) = 3.45, p = .02. Group 1 had a higher mean than group 2, t(48) = 1.56, p<.05, but did not differ from group 3, t(48) = .34, p = .74. We found no difference between men and women, t(148) = .73, p = .763."
stat <- statcheck(txt)

identify(stat)
```

If you run this code, you will see the non-APA plot:

<!-- <img src="statcheckIdentify_screenshot1.png" align="middle" height="400" width="664" margin="0 auto" /> -->

In the plot you can see two things: firstly, there is a cross next to one of the points. This is a cursor/locator with which you can click on the points in the plot that you are interested in. The second thing you see, is that in the top left corner of the plot it says "Locator active (Esc to finish)". This means that when you're finished clicking the points you're interested in, press Esc to exit the plot. When you do, the points you clicked in the plot will be numbered and statcheck will give you the results of these points in a data frame:

<!-- <img src="statcheckIdentify_screenshot2.png" align="middle" height="400" width="664" margin="0 auto" /> -->

<!-- <img src="statcheckIdentify_screenshot3.png" align="middle" height="400" width="664" margin="0 auto" /> -->

As you can see in the data frame and the plot, the 2nd and 4th row from the output are selected with the identify function for further inspection.

### Summarize statcheck results

The function 'summary' uses the full statcheck data frame to calculate summarized results.

```{r summary, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
txt1 <- "We ran a manipulation check which showed that the stimulus achieved the desired effect, Z = 1.99, p < .05"
txt2 <- "We found a significant difference between groups, F(3, 147) = 3.45, p = .02. Group 1 had a higher mean than group 2, t(48) = 1.56, p<.05, but did not differ from group 3, t(48) = .34, p = .74. We found no difference between men and women, t(148) = .73, p = .763."

stat <- statcheck(c(txt1,txt2))

summary(stat)
```
The output shows that there were two sources with statistics scanned. The summary indicates how many results were extracted per source ('pValues'), how many of those were an 'Error' or 'DecisionError'.

## Common Errors

There are several errors that can arise when installing or running statcheck. I'm currently logging the errors I encounter with their solutions. This list is far from complete, so if you have an error you can't solve, or come across something that you think could be a bug, please contact me at m.b.nuijten@uvt.nl.

### Rcpp

While installing statcheck, you can come across the Error that the package Rcpp is not available:

```{r error_Rcpp, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) :

* removing 'D:/R-3.2.3/library/statcheck'
* restoring previous 'D:/R-3.2.3/library/statcheck'

```

Here the solution is quite straightforward. Just re-install the package Rcpp manually:

```{r solution_Rcpp, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("Rcpp")
```

### Xcode license on Mac

When installing statcheck on Mac, you need to install Xcode. If your license is expired, you can get the following Warning:

```{r error_Xpdflicense, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
> devtools::install_github("MicheleNuijten/statcheck")
Downloading github repo MicheleNuijten/statcheck@master
Installing statcheck
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R' --vanilla CMD INSTALL  \
  '/private/var/folders/bh/r4jqk1zj4kzfyd8g9x7bdysc0000gn/T/RtmpW6A5Dc/devtools416756816ec1/MicheleNuijten-statcheck-d20d222'  \
  --library='/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library'  \
  --install-tests 

* installing *source* package ‘statcheck’ ...
** R
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading


Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.


Warning: running command ''otool' -L '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/tcltk/libs//tcltk.so'' had status 69
```

The solution can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26197347/agreeing-to-the-xcode-ios-license-requires-admin-privileges-please-re-run-as-r and entails simply entering the following code on the command line:

```{r solution_Xpdflicense, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
sudo xcodebuild -license
```
